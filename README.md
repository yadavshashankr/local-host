5. Once connected, you can:
   - Click or drag files to send
   - View transfer progress
   - See file history
   - Download received files

## üíª Usage

### Connecting to a Peer

1. **Share Your ID**:
   - Copy your Peer ID using the copy button
   - On mobile, use the share button
   - Or let others scan your QR code

2. **Connect to Someone**:
   - Enter their Peer ID in the "Connect to Peer" field
   - Click "Connect"
   - Wait for the connection to establish (green status indicator)

### Sending Files

1. **Select Files**:
   - Click the drop zone to select files
